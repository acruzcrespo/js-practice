# JavaScript Fundamentals Practice

This project allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them. This week was all about JavaScript fundamentals. You have studied variables, functions, object literals, arrays, this keyword, prototypes, and class syntax. In this project, you will practice by completing a number of JavaScript problems.

## Description

There are several JavaScript files being brought into the index.html file. Each of those files contain JavaScript problems you need to solve. Skip around if you get stuck.

At the end of the project, you should have a console full of correct responses to the problems given.

## Task 1: Objects and Arrays

Test your knowledge of objects and arrays.
